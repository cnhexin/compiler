# Fall-2018

Overview:
	I have written a compiler. The source language is a small subset of C, called Mini-C, and the target language is an Intermediate Code which will be executed by a simple IC interpreter. Also I have finished a parser to parse the program from string to abstract syntax tree. At the same time, I wrote a interpreter which can interprete the program to get the print output.
